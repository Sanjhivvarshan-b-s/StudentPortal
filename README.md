# Student Portal Web Application

## Problem Statement

In academic environments, students often face difficulties in **clarifying doubts and getting timely guidance from teachers**. Traditional classroom setups or generic portals can lead to:

1. Unanswered or overlooked student questions

2. Lack of prioritization for important doubts

3. Confusing or fragmented classroom interactions

4. Inefficient communication between students and teachers

These issues result in **delayed learning, reduced engagement, and ineffective knowledge transfer**.

## Project Objective

The **Student Portal Web Application** aims to **streamline student–teacher interaction** and provide a **role-based academic platform**. The system:

1. Allows students to **submit doubts and questions**

2. Implements a **voting system** so students can prioritize doubts

3. Provides **dedicated dashboards** for students, teachers, and administrators

4. Supports classroom management, academic interaction, and content organization

5. Enhances overall **learning efficiency and engagement**

## Our Approach

### 1. User Authentication & Role Management

Implement **login functionality** with **role-based dashboards** for students, teachers, and administrators.

### 2. Doubt Submission & Voting System

Students can **submit doubts**, and peers can **vote on the importance** of each doubt. This allows teachers to **focus on high-priority questions**.

### 3. Dashboard & Classroom Interface

- Student dashboard shows submitted doubts, votes, and responses

- Teacher dashboard displays top-voted doubts and classroom interactions

- Admin dashboard manages users and overall platform content

### 4. Backend & Frontend Integration

- Built with **Python (Flask)** for backend routing and database interaction

- Uses **HTML templates** and **CSS** for front-end rendering

- Stores data locally using **SQLite** for simplicity and rapid prototyping

### 5. Continuous Improvement

The system can be **expanded to include additional features** like notifications, assignments, or analytics to enhance learning outcomes.

## Outcomes

- **Streamlined doubt resolution** – students get answers to important questions faster

- **Prioritized learning** – teachers focus on the most voted doubts

- **Improved classroom interaction** – organized dashboards for all roles

- **Hands-on learning platform** – provides students and developers experience with **full-stack web development**
